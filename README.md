### Deployment

To run the theme locally, navigate to the theme directory and run `bundle install` to install the dependencies, then run `jekyll serve` or `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start the Jekyll server.

I would recommend checking the [Deployment Methods](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/deployment-methods/) page on Jekyll website.

### Posts

To create a new post, you can create a new markdown file inside the \_posts directory by following the [recommended file structure](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#creating-post-files).

      ---
      layout: post
      title: Premiere on Broadway
      date: 2018-08-23 16:04:00 +0300
      image: 03.jpg
      tags: [Rest]
      ---
          

You can set the tags and the post image.

Add post images to **/img/** directory.

For tags, try to not add space between two words, for example, `Ruby on Rails`, could be something like (`ruby-on-rails`, `Ruby_on_Rails`, or `Ruby-on-Rails`).

### Update favicon

You can find the current favicon (favicon.ico) inside the theme root directory, just replace it with your new favicon.
